#FantomCMS

FantomCMS is a Web Content Management System initially developed as a course project for CMPS115 at UC Santa Cruz.

We aim to create a functional, modular content management system using the Fantom language that allows for the simple creation of a single-page web application.

#Repository Information

The master branch should always compile into a functional application. Development occurs on branches and is tested before being merged into master. FantomCMS is modular, and as such each module is stored in a "pod" file, which is placed into the lib/fan directory. Each pod should have a specific purpose.

Our program is developed using the Fantom language. As this is a lesser known language, we have opted to include the interpreter in the bin directory. Once compiled, the program can be launched using the fcms executable in the bin directory.
